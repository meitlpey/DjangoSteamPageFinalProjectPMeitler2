# DjangoSteamPageFinalProjectPMeitler
Project by Peyton Meitler

## Description/Overveiw
This is my final project for my INF601 Advanced Programming with Python class.
This project will use the free steam API to pull information from my steam account.
This information will then be shown to the user of my site in a neat orderly fashion.

## Please run the following
```angular2html
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
